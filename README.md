pro-flight
==========

Flight control software written in rust, aims to provide more convenience for developers
and better OSD experience for users.

Why pro-flight?
===============

There are some popular flight-control software like Betaflight, INAV, PX4 and ardupilot,
which is indeed mature and stable, while programming language they're using is C/C++ which
is a bit of outdated, and besides:
* all of them provides an ugly OSD
* Betaflight and INAV is written in C, and codestyle is not very good
* PX4 and ardupilot uses RTOS for concurrency, but with async and interrupt based thread
  RTOS is no longer nessesary, and we'll achieve minimum latency
* being lack of package manager their repository is huge, full filled with self made wheels

In conclusion, I want to customize my own flight-control software while not willing to
use C/C++.

Here's a sample OSD output:
